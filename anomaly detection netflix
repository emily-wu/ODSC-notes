-AWS
-Hadoop + S3
- 10x slower latency to write to S3 rather than native HDFS

Data Platform: s3
500 bill events through kafka -> router -> written to s3
also data from cassandra->agishus->s3
pig on hadoop for processing <-> s3
<->presto is super efficiant for rough queries
->druid backend data store good for aggregates. rigid schema
<->spark

anonaly detection:
RSVD/RPCP
-paper to read decompose matrix to 3 distinct sets: low rank, e air(noisy), o is outlier/sparse component
-with matrix x, run computations

steps:
start with vanilla SVD(single value decomp):
Threshold singular values decrement by a constant 
parameter free
calculate residual

conrrespondence analysis
ARIMA-> robust realization systems

evaluation:
stochastic unit tests
do regression testing
